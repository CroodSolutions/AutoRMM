# Looking Beyond RMM

As we were working on AutoRMM, BushidoToken pointed out that EDR products were being used in a similar manner. It seemed like it could be intersting to explore several EDR/AV products to see if any would be easy to abuse, by signing up for unverified free trial subscriptions.  

Our findings fell into a few categories:
 - Companies that did not fall for it / seemed to have a decent validation process.
 - Products that gave us an immediate free trial, but had very limited abuse potential or built in safeguards.
 - EDR/AV vendors that gave us an immediate unverfied free trial and demonstrated real abuse potential.

# Initial Findings

Products with immediate unverified free trial and significant abuse potential:
 - ESET Protect
 - Trend Vision One
