This is a placeholder for future research on enhanced detection logic. Note that specific detection logic for each RMM may also be provided in the folders for each RMM tool, along with the test scripts.  In cases where the best detection logic is provided by other projects or sites we know about, we will provide these links in each Readme file.    

At this time the best resource that I know of is the LOL RMM site, but we will add other resources as time goes on.
