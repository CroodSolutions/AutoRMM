Action1 is a relatively full-featured and user friendly RMM tool, which takes at least some care to validate users and prevent abuse.  While they have a verification process and require validation prior to unlocking the full capability set, it is probably safe to say that Social Engineering and impersonation could be tactics used by adversaries.  It was obvious that they care about preventing abuse and are trying though, which is not the case with every RMM tool. 

It was curious that features available to unvalidated accounts include the ability change any local account password and to turn the local firewall off, in other words, basically what is needed to just remote directly to the host, assuming if it is reachable (in reality, this is probably a minority of circumstances).  

Installation is very easy and seamless, which can be an advantage to both legitimate users and red teams / adversaries.  Since they allow for users to manage up to 200 hosts for free, this is definitely one to hunt for or block, if you are not an actual customer.  While the tool does not seem to support full unattended access, they pop up user prompt to accept or reject, and then allow the connection if no response from the user (call this partial unattended access).
