# Outtakes

This will be a summary of tools we have tested and/or analyzed, but did not create a test script for, for various reasons.

# DWservice (DWS)

This service had a rather rough interface and the method for admin deployment did not seem to work in our limited testing. It provides folder and file access, command line, and other capabilities once installed and is a free tool, so the abuse potential is definitely there. On the up side, the install exe had lots of user interactions and the silent install did not seem to work at all.  We determined it was not a tool that would be a good candidate for test scripts; however, it should be one that you block if you are not using it for legitimate purposes.
