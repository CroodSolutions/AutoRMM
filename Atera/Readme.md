Atera is seems to be a full featured and easy to use RMM platform, which was easy to setup and intuitive to use.  

Registration for a trial was easy and the ability to start using the tool was almost immediate, including what was needed to deploy agents and remotely manage the first host.  Atera integrates SplashTop for immediate unattended remote access once installed.  There was no sign to the client that a remote session had been established, so it was kind of wicked once the MSI was on there (compared with other tools that require acknowledgement or at least flash something onscreen that users may notice).

The MSI install as the only option does make it harder to initially get on a host, but the ease to launch seamless unattended remote access via Splashtop was wicked. 

How to get started in testing Atera:
 - Purchase the product or start your free trial at: https://www.atera.com/products/rmm/
 - It will prompt you to add your first device, but otherwise go to devices, new device, agent installer, and follow the propts.
 - Select share download via link and click copy.
 - Save the appropriate AutoRMM script for your testing and paste in the link copied where it says (Paste Install URL here).
 - Test following the instructions in the Readme.md or comments for each script.

Remember to use all AutoRMM tools only for ethical and legal self assessment, testing, or administration.
