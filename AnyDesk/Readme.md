AnyDesk is a convenient and feature-rich Remote Management Tool (RMM) that is widely used due to perceived ease of use and performance. 

Unfortunately, this tool is also perceived to be easy to use by cybercriminals as well, evident by AnyDesk consistently appearing on lists of the most abused tools out there. Based upon our analysis, this is due to it installing in the user space and allowing for tremendous capabilities on the host, without user interaction. Safeguards against abuse seem to be almost non-existent.
