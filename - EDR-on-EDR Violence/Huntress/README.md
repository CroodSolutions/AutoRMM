While Huntress provided a trial right away without verification, it did not allow for any high risk capabilities we could find, with the one exception of being able to contain a host. As mentioned in the main readme for EDR abuse, containment is a relatively low risk, but can be used in theory to blind other EDR products (such as the one they legitimately use, if a competing product is deployed via an adversary using a free trial).
