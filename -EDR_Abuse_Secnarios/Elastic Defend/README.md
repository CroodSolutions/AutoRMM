# Summary

Elastic allows you to create a free trial account instantly, which includes a subscription to Elastic Defend for endpoint security. There aren't many built-in features for response within Elastic Defend, but it *can* isolate hosts out of the box. We were able to do this without alerting other EDR products, which would make it much easier to carry out other attack stages. While not as scary as some of the other products, this is still something to look out for.
